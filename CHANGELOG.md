# Changelog

All notable changes to tldr-experts. Dates are the day the work landed on `main`.

## 0.0.1 — 2026-08-29

First published version. Pre-alpha: the v0 loop runs end to end, and the parts
that do not exist yet exit `64` and say so rather than pretending.

### What is implemented

- **`tldrx init`** — detects repos, stack, package manager, default branch and
  build/test commands from the filesystem and `git` alone (no LLM, no network);
  writes `.tldrx/workspace.yml`, the code map under `.tldrx/map/**`, the init
  handoff, an interview containing only the real gaps, seeded experts at level 0,
  `conventions/`, `process.yml` and an empty `facts.yml`, plus a marked block in
  `.gitignore` and `CLAUDE.md`. Re-running keeps everything a human authored.
- **`tldrx map --refresh | --check`** — rebuilds the map, or resolves every
  `[src: …]` citation in it against the filesystem and exits `1` naming the ones
  that no longer land. Providers: `graphify` when it is on PATH, otherwise a
  static provider (file tree, manifests, 90-day git churn).
- **`tldrx doctor`** — runs every check in `env.yml` and prints the table. Exit
  `0` only when every required tool meets its `min_version`. `--mcp` adds live
  MCP health checks.
- **The run lifecycle** — `run new <slug>` seeds `tldrx-work/<yymmdd>-<slug>/`
  from a scope preset and its stage files, with per-phase budget ceilings scaled
  to `--budget`; `run status` renders the execution path, the money and what the
  run is waiting on; `answer`, `approve` and `reject` are the human half.
  `approve` re-runs the stage's declared checks against what is on disk before it
  will advance anything.
- **`run new --from <dir>`** — the AI-DLC distill: reads a listed set of files
  from an intent folder, turns each bullet into a sourced Finding and each
  answered question into a fact, drops the unanswered, and turns a claim that
  contradicts a non-retired fact into a question rather than overwriting it.
  Deterministic; no model runs.
- **`tldrx next`, in two execution modes** — headless (`tldrx next` spawns
  `claude -p` itself) and in-session (`--prepare` writes the prompt bundle, the
  host Claude Code session dispatches its own sub-agent, `--commit` picks it up).
  From "re-read the declared outputs off disk" onwards both are the same code:
  same validation, same checks, same cost roll-up, same gate. `--dry-run` keeps
  the handoff and reverts the rest.
- **Six hooks** — `claim-sources` (a handoff bullet without a resolvable `[src:]`
  is denied), `no-re-ask` (a question `facts.yml` already answers is denied),
  `answer-capture` (records the answer, the fact and the event), `dod-gate`
  (re-runs a story's `dod` block; the one hook that fails closed), `budget-gate`
  and `session-start`. Everything but `dod-gate` fails open.
- **`tldrx expert list | create | train --print-prompt`** — experts are files.
  `list` recomputes every level from evidence before printing it and warns when
  the stored number disagrees.
- **`tldrx replay`** — `events.jsonl` rendered as a stakeholder narrative.
- **`tldrx retro [--apply]`** — five deterministic heuristics over the event log,
  each citing the line that proves it; `--apply` appends the proposals to
  `practices.md`, idempotently.
- **`tldrx dashboard --static`** — one self-contained `index.html`, no external
  request in any `src`/`href`.
- **Runtime: Node ≥ 20 or Bun.** Every capability that differs between the two
  lives behind `src/core/runtime/`; a test asserts no `Bun.` call site survives
  outside it. The published bundle inlines its one devDependency, so an install
  resolves zero runtime dependencies.

### What is NOT implemented

- **Build and Watch phase execution.** The stages, their contracts and the story
  and wave file shapes exist; running them does not. Story/epic/`waves.yml`
  schemas are still an open decision.
- **Expert training.** `expert train` prints the prompt to paste and exits `64`
  without `--print-prompt`. Running the training loop, and writing the resulting
  `knowledge/*.md` and levels back, is v1.1.
- **The live dashboard.** `dashboard` without `--static` exits `64`. The watching
  server is v1.
- **The ticket adapter.** No Jira or GitHub integration ships. Direction
  (mirror-only vs two-way) and which one lands first are undecided.
- **Parallel execution.** v0 runs one stage at a time, one task at a time.

### Notes

- `tldrx <command> --help` prints usage and exits `0` without needing a
  workspace. `--root <path>` works on every command that touches one.
- A `failed` stage is not progress and not the end: `run status` renders it as a
  failure, `tldrx next` retries it, and `reject --note` sends it back to `ready`
  with the note fed into the next prompt.
